Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This site serves as a portfolio showcasing some of the work I've completed throughout my career, graduate and undergraduate studies, and internships in-between.

ðŸš§  Please note this site is currently under semi-active construction

I'm currently a geospatial and carbon markets analyst at Trove Research

Previously, I have spent 5 good years in academia, in university or research internships in-between. I hold a Masters in Physics, after which I spent a year as a graduate researcher and PhD Candidate studying Atmospheric Physics and Machine Learning. I've been lucky to learn at these institutions, and hope more good fortune comes my way!

Please have a look at my :
- CV
- Career & Work experience
- Portfolio: graduate & internship research
- Coursework : some graduate and undergraduate coursework in Theoretical and Computational Physics

Feel free to reach me via LinkedIn. I do not have any other social media presence.
