Hi there!

Welcome to my home on the internet - I'm using this site as a mini-portfolio showcasing some work I've completed throughout my graduate and undergraduate studies, and internships in between.

I'm currently a physics graduate at the University of Toronto, studying Atmospheric Physics and Machine learning things. I hold a Masters in Physics, and have spent most of my time in education or research internships. I've been lucky to study and learn at these places, and hope more good fortune comes my way!

Have a peruse at :
- my CV
- graduate research
- coursework

Feel free to reach me by e-mail.
