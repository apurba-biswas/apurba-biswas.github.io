Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Apurba

I'm a Geospatial and Carbon Markets Analyst at Trove Research, a growing start-up that advocates for the use of carbon markets as a method to combat climate change, and transparently curb the world's CO2 emissions. We deliver data and analytics through our intelligence platform, Trove Intelligence.

Before my role at Trove, I spent a good five years in academia, spending summers between semesters pursuing research internships.

I hold a Masters in Physics from the University of Southampton, after which I spent a year as a graduate researcher studying Atmospheric Physics and Machine Learning at the University of Toronto. 

I've been lucky to learn from many scientists at different institutions, and hope more good fortune comes my way

Please have a look at my :
- CV
- Experience
- Portfolio: graduate & internship research
- Coursework: some graduate and undergraduate coursework in Theoretical and Computational Physics

Feel free to reach me via LinkedIn. I do not have any other social media presence.
