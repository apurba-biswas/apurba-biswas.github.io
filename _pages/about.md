Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my home on the internet - I'm using this site as a portfolio showcasing some of the work I've completed throughout my graduate and undergraduate studies, and internships inbetween.

ðŸš§ Please note this site is currently under semi-active construction

I'm currently a physics graduate at the University of Toronto, studying Atmospheric Physics and Machine learning things. I hold a Masters in Physics, and have spent most of my time in education or research internships. I've been lucky to learn at these institutions, and hope more good fortune comes my way!

Have a look at my :
- CV
- graduate research
- internship
- some undergraduate coursework

Feel free to reach me by Github/e-mail by apu.biswas_at_mail.utoronto.ca
