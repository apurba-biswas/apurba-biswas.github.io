This project was undertaken Summer 2021. I was being guided by Professor Dylan Jones and senior PhD student Tai-Long He, both at the University of Toronto. I was working remotely with the 5 hour time difference (due to COVID). Fortunately, I was  able to attend the weekly group meetings on Thursdays 7pm with a cup of tea. I learnt about the group members' research, falling broadly under Atmospheric Modelling and Composition. As for my own research, a lot of the foundational work was completed by Tai-long He, which I've heavily drawn from. The statistical analysis was guided by Professor Jones. It is with their help I've been able to complete this work. 

### Research

Following Tai-long [1], I further investigated the deep learning model used to predict summertime ozone concentrations over the US. We were interested in what gave the model it's temporal skill, and why it was able to capture the dynamics well. One way of approaching this problem was through explicitly looking at feature importance, by excluding certain meteorological features and then conducting a regional analysis. We hoped to gain some insight of what dynamics the model was learning. My analysis shows after feature exclusion, there were some differences in predictive skill and that these mainly dependent on region. The results were in agreement with Tai-long's findings, and emphasised the importance of including NOx emission sectors.

At the beginning of summer, I spent time reproducing most of the results in the archival paper (including appendices) by independently conducting my own model runs and analysis. With little previous experience, this gave me an oppurtunity to learn Deep Learning in Tensorflow and climate analysis with Xarray.  By  the end, I gave a semi-formal 40-minute presentation to the group. [You can find the slides here](https://github.com/apurba-biswas/apurba-biswas.github.io/blob/master/files/group_presentation.pdf)

An even more informal explanation lies below, which I hope is more accessible, succint and somewhat complete. Feel free to send me comments/questions/feedback on the work below.

## Why is ozone important?

Tropospheric (ground-level/near-surface) ozone, is a major air pollutant and a greenhouse gas. As an air pollutant, ozone risks those who are already have a compromised respiratory systems (e.g. asthma)and children. It's oxidative capability also impacts crop yield. As a greenhouse gas, it is much more **potent than CO2**.


### Why is this a tricky problem?

Ozone is not directly emitted by most anthropogenic activity. Instead, it's produced in the atmosphere by a chemical reaction, composed of NOx (nitrous oxides), VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and UV radiation. Due to the photochemical reaction, ozone concentrations are high during summertime. This reaction, however is complicated and non-linear. 

A recent example demonstrating this complexity would be the concentration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon lockdown in several countries (China, India, US, UK), NOx emissions from transport (and indirectly other sectors) were reduced. However, this would not immediately be obvious in the ozone concentrations.

_Atmospheric models used to simulate the distribution of ozone typically do not reproduce the observed long-term trend in tropospheric ozone. Furthermore, these models tend to overestimate summertime surface ozone abundances in the United States._ [1]

### Data




### The model

Being inspired by Shi et al, [2] Tai-long devised a Recurrent U-Net model, to capture spatial and temporal variation in ozone concentrations over the US. The hybrid model consists of stacked CNNs and LSTMs, to learn spatial correlations and dynamics respectively. Use of skip-connections preserves higher-level features of the model.
