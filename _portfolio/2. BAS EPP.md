This project was undertaken in the Summer of 2018, before the ultimate year of my Masters degree. I moved from Southampton to the Cambridge in order to intern at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) for the summer. Amongst my supervisors, I was fortunate to meet many wonderful people at BAS. I had many discussions on things I'd never heard about over lunch (and once a campfire) - it was a diverse and collaborative environment. This was my first exposure to atmospheric dynamics and space weather physics. My time there with the people, the subject and the city consolidated my wish to further pursue research. 

I was lead by Tracy Moffat-Griffin (gravity wave dynamicist) and Andrew Kavanagh (space weather scientist). By analysing CMIP6 data, my work served as preliminary research, digging for a signal in middle atmospheric dynamics in response to energetic particle precipitation.Following the internship, I took an advanced course on Space Plasma Physics by my personal tutor Daniel Whiter (aurora physicist), which colored the knowledge from my internship.
