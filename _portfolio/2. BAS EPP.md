<<<<<<< HEAD
This project was undertaken Summer 2018. I was being guided by [Tracy Moffat Griffin](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/tmof/) and [Andrew Kavanagh](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/andkav/) at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge. This was one of the most memorable and formative summers, academically, professionally and also personally. I was introduced to Atmospheric Physics (and hence went onto pursue the PhD at UofT) and also [Space Plasma Physics](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/phys6004#syllabus), studying more the following semester under my tutor [Daniel Whiter](https://www.astro.soton.ac.uk/people/daniel_whiter.html). This is where I learnt to leverage the scientific python stack (numpy, pandas, scipy), and also present my results (in the now defacto standard) Jupyter Notebooks. During the summer, I'd decided I wanted to become a scientific software engineer, helping scientists further pursue science.

This project was undertaken in the Summer of 2018, before the ultimate year of my Masters degree. I moved from Southampton to the Cambridge in order to intern at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) for the summer. Amongst my supervisors, I was fortunate to meet many wonderful people at BAS. I had many discussions on things I'd never heard about over lunch (and once a campfire) - it was a diverse and collaborative environment. This was my first exposure to atmospheric dynamics and space weather physics. My time there with the people, the subject and the city consolidated my wish to further pursue research. 

I was lead by Tracy Moffat-Griffin (gravity wave dynamicist) and Andrew Kavanagh (space weather scientist). By analysing CMIP6 data, my work served as preliminary research, digging for a signal in middle atmospheric dynamics in response to energetic particle precipitation.Following the internship, I took an advanced course on Space Plasma Physics by my personal tutor Daniel Whiter (aurora physicist), which colored the knowledge from my internship.

## Analysis

Briefly, the analysis we were conducting required me to:
- remove daily tidal influence. We found dominant modes with periods of 8hr, 12hr and ~24 hr using Lomb-Scargle analysis
- following which, we constructed windows of +/- 10 days from the energetic particle precipitation events
- then a superposed epoch analysis (a fancy term for averaging epochs)

I analysed  ~21 years of raw data. We found some signal for high and middle energy proton events at the +4 to 6 day marks, however, there was not enough events for a statistically significant conclusion. 

I left my supervisors Tracy Moffat Griffin and Andrew Kavanagh with interactive notebooks, so they could alter the energy thresholds for  of what low/middle/high energetic particle precipitation events, as this effected the number of epochs we had in each category. This required me to heavily document and package my code, as they were not familiar with Python the python ecosystem at all.
