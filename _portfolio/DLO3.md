This research was undertaken Summer 2021, whilst being guided by Prof. Dylan Jones and senior PhD student Tai-Long He, both at the University of Toronto. I was sitting in London (not the one in Ontario), and was working "remotely" with the 5 hour time difference, due to COVID-19. Fortunately, I was still able to regularly attend the weekly group meetings on Thursdays 7pm, with a cup of tea. I was able to learn about the various group members' research, all falling broadly under Atmospheric Modelling and Composition (chemistry)

## Research

Following the work of Tai-long [1], I further investigated a deep learning model which was used to predict summertime ozone concentration over the US. We were interested in what gave the model it's temporal skill, and why it was able to capture the dynamics 

### Why is this a tricky problem?

Ozone is unlike the common air pollutants, as it is not directly emitted by anthropogenic activity. It is, however, produced in the atmospheric as a chemical reaction, composed of NOx (nitrous oxides) and sunlight. This reaction, however is complicated and non-linear (more NOx doesn't necessarily mean more ozone).
A good example to demonstrate this would be the ozone concentration during the COVID-19 pandemic. When lockdown's been imposed in several countries (China, India, US, UK), NOx emissions from transport (and indirectly other sectors)* were reduced. However, this would not immediately be obvious in the ozone concentrations.

### Why summertime?



### The model

Being inspired by Shi et al, [2] Tai-long devised a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, to capture spatial and temporal variation

### Regional analysis

My results

### Future work
