This was my 2021 summer research, being guided by Prof. Dylan Jones and fellow PhD student Tai-long He.

This post contains, as simply as possible, the description of the work.

Following Tai-long's work [1], I investigated the hybrid deep learning model used to predict ozone concentration over the US.

To start, I spent a bit of time reproducing prior results, to verify them and become familiar with Compute Canada's HPC system Graham.
